                                <p>We recently worked with Adept Photo Booths for 'Origin Fan Fest', a State of Origin themed event hosted in Yagan Square. The team at Adept photo booths always go above and beyond our expectations with the product they deliver, they are easy to work with and look forward to working with them on future events.”</p>

                                <p>We had the pleasure of having Adept Photo Booths at our stall for the community Spring Fair on the weekend. We had opted for the open photo booth which was a great hit, it attracted a lot of people into our stall, the print off photos were great quality which gave those wanting their photos taken a little keepsake from the weekend. Their staff are friendly and great with interacting with the community. We look forward to our next collaborative event with Adept Photo Booths</p>

                                <p>Couldn’t recommend these guys highly enough! I used the Green Screen Photo Booth for an activation recently and everyone loved it! The photos looked fantastic and being able to send them straight to your mobile was great. Colin and the team were so easy to work with, making to the whole process super simple and enjoyable</p>
